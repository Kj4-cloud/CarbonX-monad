## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

- **Frontend Framework**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for lightning-fast development and optimized production builds.
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a utility-first, fully responsive, and premium UI design (including custom dark/light modes).
- **Authentication & Database**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for secure, role-based user authentication (Farmers vs. Standard Users) and real-time database management.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

CarbonX aims for a **premium, professional, and eco-friendly** aesthetic. 
- The color palette heavily relies on rich emerald greens (`#13ec6d`), dark forest themes, and crisp white/slate tones.
- Typography is driven by `Manrope` for clean, modern readability.
- The UI incorporates subtle glassmorphism, smooth animations (`animate-slide-up`, `animate-fade-in`), and interactive hover states to ensure a dynamic user experience.
